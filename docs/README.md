# Ruter OTA Message Schemas

This site and the associated repo documents the formats of the over-the-air (OTA) messages that are exchanged between the PTA BO and public transport running ITxPT.

There is [a detailed page describing the messages](https://ruterno.github.io/ota-schemas/mqtt/index.html).
